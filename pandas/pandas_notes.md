## Transforming Data

In this chapter we will learn the basics of pandas including sorting rows, subsetting, and adding new columns. 

pandas is designed to rectangular data such as this:

Each column is a **feature** while each row is an **observation**. In pandas, such a table is represented by a **data frame**. Columns can contain various data types. 

### Basic Exploratory Commands

pandas has various methods to explore a data frame. These include: 

*   `.head()` - to view the first five observations in a data frame. Adding a number in the parenthesis will return that many observations. By default, it is 5. 
*   `.info()` - displays the names of the columns, the data types of these columns, the number of non-null columns, and how much memory the data frame takes.
*   `.shape` - shows the total number of rows and columns of a data frame. As this is an attribute, we write it without the parenthesis.
*   `.describe()` - computes descriptive statistics of the numerical columns such as mean, median and so on. 
*   `.values` - returns a list of values (if you do it on a given column) or returns a list of lists if done on a data frame.
*   `.columns` - returns an index of column names
*   `.index` - returns the row numbers or row names 

### Sorting

The data frame in pandas can be sorted using the `.sort_values()` command. This method takes the name of the column that is to be sorted as its argument. For example, if we have a data frame with column `color`, we would do the following:

```python
df.sort_values('color')
```

By default the `.sort_values()` sorted the column by ascending order. By setting `ascending=False`, we can sort the column in descending order: 

```python
df.sort_values('color', ascending=False)
```

We can **sort a data frame by multiple columns** by passing a list of column names: 

```python
df.sort_values(['color', 'weight'], ascending=[True, False])
```

Here we sort two columns, the first in ascending order and the second in a descending order. 

### Subsetting

We can subset a data frame by using the square brackets. For example, if we wish to look at one column, we can do the following: 

```python
df['color']
```

 This will give just the values of the column `color`.  

To select multiple columns, we need a list: 

```python
df[['color', 'weight']]
```

We can subset the data based on logical condition. For example, 

```python
df[df['weight'] > 100]
```

This will return the data frame with observations for which the weight is greater than 100. The inner command, `df['weight'] > 100` , creates a mask of boolean values. The outer command then simply outputs the observations for which the condition is `True`. 

We can also subset data based on text: 

```python
df[df['color'] == 'pink']
```

We can s**ubset the data using multiple conditions** using the `&` or the `|` operators. The first operator subsets the data when condition A **and** B are true while the second operator subsets the condition when either A **or** B are true. 

```python
df[ (df["color"] == 'pink') & (df['weight'] < 50)]
```

Note the use of parenthesis to separate the conditions. 

When you wish to **subset on categorical variables**, the easiest is to use the `.isin()` operator: 

```python
df[df['color'].isin(['pink', 'red'])]
```

This will result in observations for which the color is either pink OR red. 

### Adding a New Column

Adding a new column can be done in several ways. Let's first look at creating a new column based on an existing column. Suppose we have a column `distance` in miles. We wish to convert that into kilometers. Here's how we can do this: 

```python
df.loc[:, 'distance_km'] df.loc[:, 'distance'] * 1.64
```



## Aggregating Data

In this section, youâ€™ll calculate summary statistics on DataFrame columns, and master grouped summary statistics and pivot tables.

### Summarize Numerical Variables

The **summary statistics** that we can use on a given data frame are all methods: 

*   `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.mode()`
*   `.min()`, `.max()`
*   `.var()`, `.std()`
*   `.sum()`, `.quantile()`

We can also create custom summary statistics using the `.agg()` method: 

```python
def pct30(column):
    return column.quantile(0.3)

df['weights'].agg(pct30)
```

Here the `.agg()` column takes the name of the custom-defined function and computes the 30th percentile. 

We can use `.agg()` on multiple columns by simply passing a list: 

```python
df[['weights', 'heights']].agg(pct30)
```

We could also pass a list of functions in `.agg()` to apply multiple columns: 

```python
df[['weights', 'heights']].agg([min, max])
```

If you want to use `mean` or other descriptive statistics functions inside the `agg()` function, make use of numpy such as, 

```python
df[['weights', 'heights']].agg([np.mean, np.median])
```

**Cumulative statistics** can also be done on a given column using the `.cumsum()` as follows: 

```python
df['weights'].cumsum()
```

The other cumulative functions pandas has are the following: 

*   `.cummax()`
*   `.cummin()`
*   `.cumprod()`

### Summarize Categorical Variables

So far we have seen how to summarize variables that are numerical. Now we will see how we can summarize categorical variables. 

Suppose we have a dataset with multiple entries, we can remove all the duplicates using the `.drop_duplicates()` method. For example, we can identify duplicates using the `'name'` column: 

```python
df.drop_duplicates(subset='name')
```

Sometimes, we may need to use multiple columns to identify duplicates. We can pass the list of column names as the `subset`:

```python
df.drop_duplicates(subset=['name', 'breed'])
```

Once we have dropped the duplicates, we can **count the categorical variables** using the `.value_counts()` method as follows: 

```python
df['breed'].value_counts(sort=True)
```

This will return the counts associated with the column `breed` and sorted in the descending order. We can use the `normalize=True` to return the proportion of the total: 

```python
df['breed'].value_counts(normalize=True)
```

### Grouped Summary Statistics 

We can compute the summary statistics of groups. This is done using the `.groupby()`. This is exactly how it is done in SQL. 

```python
df.groupby('color')['weights'].mean()
```

Here we group the dataset by `color` and compute the mean of the `weights` for each color. 

Instead of passing just one summary statistic, we can pass multiple functions using `.agg()`: 

```python
df.groupby('color')['weights'].agg([min, max, sum])
```

 We can also do the same using multiple columns: 

```python
df.groupby(['color', 'breed'])['weights'].agg([min, max, sum])
```

So, here we group the data by `color` and `breed` and then compute the `min`, `max`, and `sum` of weights. 

### Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are something we have seen in Excel. Here's how the code differs: 

```python
# Simple Groupby: 
df.groupby('color')['weights'].mean()

# Using Pivot
df.pivot_table(values='weight', index='color')
```

Both commands will result in the same output.  The `pivot_table` uses the mean by default. 

If we wish to use a different aggregation function, we do the following: 

```python
df.pivot_table(values='weight', index='color', aggfunc=np.median)
```

We can pass multiple summary statistic values as a list: 

```python
df.pivot_table(values='weight', index='color', aggfunc=[np.median, np.mean])
```

If we wish to groupby multiple columns, we use the `columns` argument: 

```python
df.pivot_table(values='weight', index='color', columns='breed', fill_value=0
               aggfunc=[np.median, np.mean])
```

>   The difference is that what we groupby is called `index` in `pivot_table` and what we apply the aggregation function is called `values`.  For additional columns we use the variable `columns`

We add the `fill_value=0` because without it, we will have `NaN` where there is no data. 

We can add the `margins=True` flag to compute the mean values down and across the table. 

```python
df.pivot_table(values='weight', index='color', columns='breed',
              fill_value=0, margins=True)
```
